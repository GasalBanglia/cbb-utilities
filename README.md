# CBB Utilities

This is a Vercel-managed Vite/React Web app that provides various data processing utilities for a retail client of mine. The project is ongoing and features will continue to be implemented as needed.

## Current Utilities
<li>Center-Squaring -- Takes an input image of an object, pads the smaller dimension to create a new square image, finds the contours of its outline, and centers it inside the new square frame.</li>

## Utilities in Development
<li>Background removal -- Using an Amazon Lambda function, utilizes a deep convolutional neural network to remove the background from the image before cropping, squaring, and centering.</li>
